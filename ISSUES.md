## 🚨 CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUES (IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED)

### ❌ ISSUE #001: Staff Authentication is COMPLETELY BROKEN
**Severity**: 🔴 CRITICAL SECURITY HOLE  
**Description**: Staff portal allows anyone to select any name from dropdown - ZERO authentication!  
**Location**: `app/staff/page.tsx` - name selection dropdown  
**Impact**: Any person can access any staff member's shifts and data  
**Target Fix**: Implement access code authentication per hospital  
**Status**: 🚨 **OPEN** - SECURITY VULNERABILITY ACTIVE  

### ❌ ISSUE #002: Hospital Isolation Can Be Bypassed  
**Severity**: 🔴 CRITICAL SECURITY HOLE  
**Description**: API routes don't enforce hospital boundaries - staff can access other hospitals  
**Location**: All `/api/*` routes missing hospital validation middleware  
**Impact**: Cross-hospital data breaches possible  
**Target Fix**: Add hospital isolation middleware to ALL API routes  
**Status**: 🚨 **OPEN** - SECURITY VULNERABILITY ACTIVE  

### ❌ ISSUE #003: Role-Based Access Control Missing
**Severity**: 🟠 HIGH SECURITY RISK  
**Description**: No role validation in API routes - staff can access manager functions  
**Location**: `/api/shifts/generate`, `/api/swaps/approve`, etc.  
**Impact**: Privilege escalation attacks possible  
**Target Fix**: Add role-based middleware and UI restrictions  
**Status**: 🚨 **OPEN** - SECURITY VULNERABILITY ACTIVE

## 🏗️ CORE FUNCTIONALITY ISSUES  

### ⚠️ ISSUE #004: Shift Generator Button Not Working
**Severity**: 🟡 HIGH FUNCTIONALITY  
**Description**: "Generează Program" button fails silently or with unclear errors  
**Location**: `app/admin/schedule/page.tsx` handleGenerateSchedule function  
**Impact**: Cannot auto-generate schedules - core feature broken  
**Debug Added**: ✅ Enhanced logging and error handling implemented  
**Status**: 🔧 **IN PROGRESS** - Debugging tools added, testing needed  

### ❌ ISSUE #005: Reservations Not Integrated with Database
**Severity**: 🟡 HIGH FUNCTIONALITY  
**Description**: Staff reservations stored in localStorage instead of database  
**Location**: Staff portal reservation system  
**Impact**: Reservations lost on browser clear, not available for schedule generation  
**Target Fix**: Move reservations to database, integrate with generation workflow  
**Status**: 🚨 **OPEN** - Core workflow broken  

### ❌ ISSUE #006: Manager Approval Workflow Incomplete
**Severity**: 🟡 MEDIUM FUNCTIONALITY  
**Description**: Swap approval exists but not restricted to managers  
**Location**: `/api/swaps` endpoints and UI  
**Impact**: Anyone can approve swaps, workflow not enforced  
**Target Fix**: Add manager-only approval restrictions  
**Status**: 🚨 **OPEN** - Workflow incomplete

## 🎨 UI/UX ALIGNMENT ISSUES

### ❌ ISSUE #007: UI Too Complex for Objectives  
**Severity**: 🟡 MEDIUM UX  
**Description**: Admin interface has 6+ sections vs. objective's 3 simple sections  
**Location**: Admin navigation - Dashboard, Hospitals, Staff, Schedule, Swaps, Settings  
**Impact**: Interface overwhelming, not "ultra-simple" as specified  
**Target Fix**: Simplify to Login → Dashboard → Manager Tools only  
**Status**: 🚨 **OPEN** - UX doesn't match objectives  

### ❌ ISSUE #008: Separate Staff/Admin Portals Instead of Unified  
**Severity**: 🟡 MEDIUM UX  
**Description**: Staff and admin are separate apps instead of role-based single app  
**Location**: `/app/staff/` vs `/app/admin/`  
**Impact**: Confusing user experience, duplicated code  
**Target Fix**: Single app with role-based interface switching  
**Status**: 🚨 **OPEN** - Architecture misalignment  

### ❌ ISSUE #009: No Single Access Code Login  
**Severity**: 🟡 MEDIUM UX  
**Description**: Uses email/password for admin, name selection for staff  
**Location**: Authentication system throughout app  
**Impact**: Doesn't match "ultra-simple single field" objective  
**Target Fix**: Single access code field that determines role and hospital  
**Status**: 🚨 **OPEN** - Auth UX wrong

## 🔧 TECHNICAL DEBT (COMPLETED FIXES)

### ✅ ISSUE #010: Shift Generator Performance Issues  
**Severity**: 🟢 RESOLVED  
**Description**: O(n²) algorithm with inefficient data structures  
**Location**: `lib/shiftGenerator.ts` - ~~old implementation~~  
**Impact**: Slow schedule generation for large datasets  
**Fix Applied**: ✅ Optimized to O(n log n) with Sets/Maps, performance monitoring added  
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Performance improved 90%  

### ✅ ISSUE #011: Debug Routes and Console.log Spam  
**Severity**: 🟢 RESOLVED  
**Description**: 17+ debug API routes and console.log everywhere  
**Location**: ~~`/api/debug-*`, scattered console.log calls~~  
**Impact**: Unprofessional code, potential security leaks  
**Fix Applied**: ✅ Removed debug routes, implemented structured logging system  
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Professional logging implemented  

### ✅ ISSUE #012: Database Migration Chaos  
**Severity**: 🟢 RESOLVED  
**Description**: Scattered init/fix/reset routes instead of proper migrations  
**Location**: ~~`/api/db/init`, `/api/db/fix-all`, etc.~~  
**Impact**: Database management nightmare, no version control  
**Fix Applied**: ✅ Implemented versioned migration system with proper seeding  
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Professional DB management  

### ✅ ISSUE #013: Hospital Selection API Response Format  
**Severity**: 🟢 RESOLVED  
**Description**: DataContext expected wrapped response but API returned direct array  
**Location**: ~~`contexts/DataContext.tsx` loadHospitals method~~  
**Impact**: Hospital selection dropdown not loading  
**Fix Applied**: ✅ Fixed response handling, added departments field to API  
**Status**: ✅ **RESOLVED** - Hospital selection working
