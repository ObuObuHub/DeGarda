# DeGarda - Shift Scheduler App

## üéØ Mission & Objectives

### Goal
Provide medical staff with an intuitive, secure platform to reserve and manage shifts while enabling managers to oversee departmental schedules within strict hospital boundaries.

### Core Objectives
1. **Multi‚Äëhospital isolation** ‚Äì Each hospital is a hard‚Äëwalled tenant; no cross‚Äëhospital visibility.
2. **Two‚Äërole model** ‚Äì Staff (reserve, view, request swaps) and Manager (approve swaps, generate schedules, department oversight).
3. **Ultra‚Äësimple authentication** ‚Äì Single‚Äëfield access code issued by the hospital; token‚Äëbased session thereafter.
4. **Core workflows** ‚Äì Reservations ‚Üí Departmental schedule generation ‚Üí Shift swaps with manager approval.
5. **Minimal, but beautiful UI** ‚Äì Login, Dashboard (calendar & actions), Manager tools tab.

### Key Models (Target Architecture)
* **Hospital** - Isolated tenant boundaries
* **Department** - Within hospital organizational units
* **User {role}** - Staff vs Manager role-based access
* **Reservation** - Staff-initiated shift preferences
* **Shift** - Generated/assigned shifts
* **SwapRequest** - Manager-approved shift exchanges

### Target User Flow
```
Staff ‚Üí Reserve dates ‚Üí Manager clicks Generate ‚Üí Schedule populated ‚Üí Staff request swap ‚Üí Manager approves ‚Üí Calendars update
```

## üìä Current Implementation Analysis

### ‚úÖ **ALIGNED**: Technical Foundation
- **Clean codebase architecture** - Well-structured Next.js app with TypeScript
- **Database design** - PostgreSQL with proper relations and constraints
- **Performance optimizations** - O(n log n) shift generation algorithms
- **Professional logging** - Structured logging system with context
- **Data models** - Hospital, Staff (roles), Shifts, Swap requests mostly implemented

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIAL**: Core Features  
- **Shift generation** - ‚úÖ Implemented but complex admin interface
- **UI design** - ‚úÖ Beautiful design but too many features
- **Swap requests** - ‚úÖ Database structure exists, needs manager approval workflow
- **Multi-hospital support** - ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic filtering but no security isolation

### ‚ùå **CRITICAL GAPS**: Security & Simplicity

#### 1. **Authentication System - BROKEN**
**Objective**: Single-field access code per hospital + token sessions
**Current**: Email/password for admin, name selection for staff (NO AUTH!)

**Issues**:
- Staff portal has ZERO authentication - just pick a name from dropdown
- No hospital-specific access codes
- Admin uses email/password instead of access codes
- Token validation exists but bypassed in staff portal

#### 2. **Multi-Hospital Isolation - SECURITY HOLES**
**Objective**: Hard-walled tenants with no cross-hospital visibility
**Current**: Basic filtering that can be bypassed

**Issues**:
- No middleware enforcing hospital boundaries
- API routes don't consistently validate hospital_id
- Frontend relies on localStorage (manipulatable)
- Staff can potentially access other hospitals via direct API calls

#### 3. **Two-Role Model - INCOMPLETE** 
**Objective**: Staff (reserve, view, swap) vs Manager (approve, generate)
**Current**: Admin/Manager/Staff roles but no proper access control

**Issues**:
- No role-based component rendering
- Staff portal exists but separate from admin (should be unified)
- Manager features mixed with admin features
- No role validation in API routes

#### 4. **UI Complexity - TOO MUCH**
**Objective**: Login, Dashboard, Manager tools (3 sections)
**Current**: Admin has 6+ navigation sections

**Issues**:
- Admin interface: Dashboard, Hospitals, Staff, Schedule, Swaps, Settings
- Staff interface: Separate app with basic calendar
- No unified manager interface
- Too many features visible at once

#### 5. **Reservation Workflow - DISCONNECTED**
**Objective**: Reservations ‚Üí Generation ‚Üí Swaps workflow
**Current**: Reservations in localStorage, generation manual, swaps separate

**Issues**:
- Reservations not saved to database
- No integration between reservation and generation
- Manual shift assignment instead of reservation-based generation
- Workflow sequence not enforced

## üö® Priority Fixes Required

### **IMMEDIATE (Security Critical)**

#### Fix #1: Implement Proper Authentication
```typescript
// Current: Staff portal has no auth
// Target: Single access code per hospital
POST /api/auth/login { accessCode: "HOSPITAL_CODE_123" }
‚Üí JWT token with { userId, hospitalId, role }
```

#### Fix #2: Enforce Hospital Isolation  
```typescript
// Add middleware to ALL API routes
middleware: validateHospitalAccess(req.user.hospitalId, req.params.hospitalId)
// Block cross-hospital data access completely
```

#### Fix #3: Role-Based Access Control
```typescript
// Protect routes by role
/api/shifts/generate ‚Üí MANAGER only
/api/shifts/reserve ‚Üí STAFF only  
/api/swaps/approve ‚Üí MANAGER only
```

### **HIGH PRIORITY (User Experience)**

#### Fix #4: Simplify UI to Match Objectives
- **Staff Interface**: Login ‚Üí Dashboard (calendar + my shifts) ‚Üí Swap requests
- **Manager Interface**: Login ‚Üí Dashboard (calendar + pending approvals) ‚Üí Generate schedules
- **Remove**: Hospitals management, Staff management, Settings complexity

#### Fix #5: Integrate Reservation Workflow
- Move reservations from localStorage to database
- Connect reservations to shift generation
- Enforce workflow: Reserve ‚Üí Generate ‚Üí Assign ‚Üí Swap

### **MEDIUM PRIORITY (Polish)**

#### Fix #6: Unified Authentication Flow
- Single login page with access code field
- Role-based redirect after authentication
- Remove separate staff/admin login flows

## üõ£Ô∏è Implementation Roadmap

### **Phase 1: Security Foundation (Week 1)**
1. **Implement access code authentication**
   - Generate unique codes per hospital
   - Replace email/password with access code login
   - Add proper JWT token validation

2. **Add hospital isolation middleware**
   - Validate hospital_id in all API routes
   - Block cross-hospital data access
   - Secure all endpoints

3. **Implement role-based access control**
   - Add role validation to API routes
   - Create role-based route protection
   - Remove unauthorized access points

### **Phase 2: UI Simplification (Week 2)**
1. **Unified authentication interface**
