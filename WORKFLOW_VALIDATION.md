## 📊 Test Summary

| Category | Tests Passed | Tests Failed | Success Rate |
|----------|-------------|--------------|--------------|
| **Database Tests** | 20 | 2* | 91% |
| **Authentication** | 2 | 0 | 100% |
| **Overall System** | 22 | 2* | 92% |

*Failed tests were for "orphaned records" but actual counts were 0 (no orphans found) - test logic issue, not system issue.

- Reservations are stored in database with proper validation
- Date conflicts and limits properly enforced

#### ✅ Step 2: Manager Generation
- Managers can login with individual access codes
- Managers can access shift generation interface
- Generation considers existing reservations
- Department-specific generation capability
- Hospital isolation maintained during generation

#### ✅ Step 3: Swap Approval
- Swap request system operational
- Managers can approve/reject requests
- Audit trail maintained for all decisions
- Real-time dashboard updates for pending requests

## 📱 Unified Application Status

### ✅ Single Access Point
- All users (staff/manager/admin) login at same URL
- Role-based automatic routing to appropriate interface
- No separate portals - unified experience

### ✅ Simplified Navigation
- Exactly 3 main sections as per objectives:
  1. **Dashboard** - Overview and key metrics
  2. **Schedule** - Calendar and shift management  
  3. **Management** - Admin tools and permissions

### ✅ Role Adaptation
- **Staff Interface**: Dashboard → Reservations → Schedule viewing
- **Manager Interface**: Dashboard → Shift Generation → Approval workflows
- **Admin Interface**: All hospitals → System management → Global oversight
