# DeGarda - Medical Shift Scheduler

**Minimal. Secure. Beautiful.** - A streamlined shift scheduling application for medical staff.

*Latest deployment: 2025-07-20 - Fixed shift generator syntax error*

## 🎯 Mission

Provide medical staff with an intuitive, secure platform to reserve and manage shifts while enabling managers to oversee departmental schedules within strict hospital boundaries.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🔐 Ultra-Simple Authentication** - Single access code per hospital
- **🏥 Multi-Hospital Isolation** - Hard-walled tenant boundaries with zero cross-visibility  
- **👥 Two-Role Model** - Staff (reserve, view, swap) vs Manager (approve, generate)
- **📱 Unified Interface** - Single app that adapts to user role
- **🔄 Complete Workflow** - Reservations → Generation → Approval
- **⚡ Zero Training Required** - Intuitive design requiring no instruction

## 🏗️ Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes with hospital isolation middleware  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (Neon) with versioned migrations
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with HTTP-only cookies
- **Security**: Role-based access control with hospital boundaries

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- PostgreSQL database (or Neon account)

### Installation

1. **Clone and install**:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/degarda.git
cd degarda
npm install
```

2. **Environment setup**:
```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# Edit .env.local with your database URL and secrets
```

3. **Database setup**:
```bash
npm run db:migrate  # Apply database migrations
npm run db:seed     # Seed with sample data
```

4. **Start development**:
```bash
npm run dev
```

## 🔐 Access Codes

### Hospital Staff Access
- **Piatra-Neamț**: `LAB`
- **Buhuși (Hospital 1)**: `BUH1`
- **Buhuși (Hospital 2)**: `BUH2`

### Manager Access
- **Administrator**: `ADM001`
- **Manager Piatra-Neamț**: `MGR101`, `MGR102`
- **Manager Buhuși**: `MGR201`, `MGR301`

## 🎯 User Workflows

### Staff Workflow
1. **Login** with hospital access code (e.g., `LAB`)
2. **Dashboard** - See overview and personal stats
3. **Reservations** - Reserve up to 3 preferred shift dates
4. **Schedule** - View assigned shifts and request swaps

### Manager Workflow
1. **Login** with manager access code (e.g., `MGR101`)
2. **Dashboard** - Approve pending swap requests
3. **Generate Shifts** - Create monthly schedules considering reservations
4. **Management** - Manage staff permissions and access codes

### Admin Workflow
1. **Login** with admin access code (`ADM001`)
2. **Multi-Hospital View** - Oversee all hospitals
3. **Global Management** - Manage managers and system settings
4. **System Administration** - Access all features across hospitals

## 📱 Interface Design

### Simplified Navigation (Max 3 Sections)
- **Dashboard** - Overview, calendar, and key metrics
- **Schedule** - Calendar view and shift management
- **Management** - Staff and system management (managers/admins only)

### Role-Based Adaptation
- **Staff**: See reservation tools and personal schedule
- **Manager**: See approval workflows and generation tools
- **Admin**: See multi-hospital controls and global settings

## 🔒 Security Features

### Hospital Isolation
- Hard tenant boundaries - no cross-hospital data access
- Hospital-specific middleware validation
- Isolated user sessions and permissions

### Authentication Security
- HTTP-only JWT cookies (no localStorage)
- Hospital-specific access codes
- Role-based route protection
- Automatic session management

### Data Protection
- Input validation on all endpoints
- SQL injection prevention
- Audit trails for manager actions
- No sensitive data in client-side storage

## 🧪 Testing

### Run Tests
```bash
npm test                    # Unit tests
npm run test:workflow      # Workflow integration tests  
npm run test:security      # Security validation tests
```

### Validate Workflow
```bash
node scripts/test-complete-workflow.js
```

## 📊 Database Schema

### Core Tables
- `hospitals` - Hospital information with access codes
- `staff` - User accounts with roles and hospital assignments
- `reservations` - Staff shift preferences (max 3/month)
- `shifts` - Generated shift assignments
- `shift_swaps` - Swap requests with manager approval
- `shift_generation_permissions` - Department-specific generation rights

### Key Relationships
- Hospital isolation enforced at database level
- Staff belong to single hospital
- Reservations link staff to preferred dates
- Swaps require manager approval within same hospital

## 🔧 API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/access-code` - Login with hospital/manager code
- `POST /api/auth/logout` - Secure logout
- `GET /api/auth/verify` - Validate JWT token

### Core Features
- `GET|POST /api/reservations` - Staff reservation management
- `GET|POST /api/shifts` - Shift data and generation
- `GET|PATCH /api/swaps` - Swap request handling
- `GET /api/staff` - Staff management (managers only)

### Hospital Isolation
All API routes include hospital validation middleware ensuring users can only access data from their assigned hospital.
