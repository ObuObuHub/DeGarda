# Real-Time Sync & Persistence Implementation

## Overview
Successfully implemented persistence and real-time synchronization features in the DeGarda v2 app.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Database Setup
- Added `notifications` table to the database schema
- Added proper indexes for performance
- Fixed database connection issues

### 2. State Management (DataContext)
- Created centralized `DataContext` for global state management
- Manages shifts, staff, hospitals, and notifications
- Implements optimistic updates for better UX
- Handles offline state detection

### 3. Real-Time Synchronization
- Created `useRealtimeSync` hook for automatic data syncing
- Implements 30-second polling interval (configurable)
- Syncs when browser tab becomes visible
- Prevents redundant syncs with timestamp tracking

### 4. Local Storage Persistence
- Selected hospital preference persists across sessions
- Stored in localStorage for quick access

### 5. API Client with Retry Logic
- Created robust API client with exponential backoff
- Automatically retries failed requests (except auth errors)
- Handles network errors gracefully

### 6. Error Handling
- Proper error boundaries and error messages
- Graceful degradation when offline
- User-friendly error notifications

## Key Features

### Cross-Device Synchronization
- Changes made on one device appear on others within 30 seconds
- Manual sync available via `syncData()` function
- Automatic sync on visibility change

### Offline Support
- Detects offline state
- Shows appropriate UI indicators
- Queues actions for when connection returns

### Performance Optimizations
- Only syncs when tab is visible
- Prevents duplicate requests
- Efficient data fetching with proper indexes

## Testing Instructions

1. Initialize the database:
   ```bash
   npm run db:init
   ```

2. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Test cross-device sync:
   - Open the app in two browser tabs/devices
   - Make a change in one tab
   - See it appear in the other within 30 seconds

4. Test offline behavior:
   - Disconnect from network
   - App should show offline indicator
   - Reconnect to see data sync automatically

## Architecture Benefits

- **Separation of Concerns**: Data logic separated from UI components
- **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with proper types
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new real-time features
- **Maintainability**: Centralized state management
- **Performance**: Optimized polling and caching strategies

## Future Enhancements

Consider implementing:
- WebSocket connection for true real-time updates
- Server-Sent Events (SSE) for push notifications
- IndexedDB for larger offline data storage
- Service Worker for background sync
- Push notifications for shift changes
